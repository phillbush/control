                       The Control Widget Toolkit

This is my attempt to understand the old X Toolkit Intrinsics system.
This is still in very initial development stage.
This is a work in progress.
This is incomplete.
This is ugly.

Demonstration programs:
• demo/include.mk:              Makefile for demonstration programs.
• demo/primitive:               Demo for the ctrlPrimitive widget.

Include files:
• include/include.mk:           Makefile for headers.
• include/control/Control.h:    General public headers.
• include/control/ControlP.h:   General private headers.
• include/control/*.h:          Public headers for widgets.
• include/control/*P.h:         Private headers for widgets.

Source files:
• lib/include.mk:               Makefile for object files.
• lib/ControlI.h:               Internal header.
• lib/ControlI.c:               Internal module.
• lib/*.c:                      Source files for widgets.

Make targets:
• make all:                     Same as `make lib`.
• make lib:                     Build libcontrol.
• make demos:                   Build demonstration programs.
• make tags:                    Build ctags for vi(1).
• make clean:                   Remove built files.
